## Description:
WhiteBoard is a web application that creates a live queue for users to join. For
example, SAL can become very packed during midterms and finals season, and it
would be very helpful if instead there was a virtual line to wait in so people
do not have to congest SAL. It can allow them to leave and work somewhere else
and come back once it is their turn to get help. Our application would allow for
the creation of an organization with administrators. There would also be general
users that can subscribe to classes and join a virtual line via scanning a QR
code. All users will be notified when their turn is up. Registered users would
also be able to view the queue at any moment to see how close it is to their
turn.
